a little hack to get textdata from the images generated  by
	http://www.industry.siemens.com/industrysolutions/global/de/blids/service/spion/Seiten/spion_de.aspx

it will take a "lightning locations" jpg image from blids.de and map
thee current lightning locations to google maps coordinates.

this is a highly specialized hack, it will work only with the images
supplied by the linked website. the generated google maps coordinates
are only valid for central europe. as soon as we cross the prime meridian
or the equator everything gets fucked up.
